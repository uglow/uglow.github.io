These are some useful regular expressions that I should remember but I don't. So I've written them here for later reference â˜º.

<dl>
<dt>Ignore whitespace chars</dt>
<dd>{% highlight console %}[\s\S]*?
"some html text with a line break and tabs between here[\s\S]*?and here"{% endhighlight %}</dd>
