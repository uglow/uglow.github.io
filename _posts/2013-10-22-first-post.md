A blog site that's not a pain-in-the-bottom to setup and configure!

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is pretty cool, but I learned more from [this theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/theme-setup/).

The [MarkDown Reference Guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) is also very useful.
