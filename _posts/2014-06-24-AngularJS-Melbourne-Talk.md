On Monday 23rd June, I was privileged to attend the first [AngularJS Melbourne Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Melbourne/events/180144952/)
as a guest speaker. Thanks to [Alex](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Melbourne/members/46442222/) for organising. The event was a great success!

I've uploaded the [presentation (PPT, 1.9MB)](/assets/files/Australia_Post_Mobile_Angular_Website_2014.pptx) from the talk.

The accompanying demo files:
