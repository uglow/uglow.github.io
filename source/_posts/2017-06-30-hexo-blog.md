It's been a while since I updated my blog site. In that time, my old MacBook Pro was replaced with a new one. So when it came time to consider how to integrate Medium onto my blog, I didn't want to have to download new versions of a toolchain - Ruby - that I never use.

Enter [Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs) - a NodeJS-based static site generator. It is similar to Jekyll but is designed to be extensible and customizable.
So far I'm loving it.
